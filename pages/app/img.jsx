      ----unseen---- The canister had always been there, rolling around at the
      bottom of his duffle bag. Whenever he packed, his fingers would graze over
      the smooth, gray top, but he’d never take it out, never look directly at
      it. Sometimes when he unpacked, the canister would get wound up in a dirty
      sock or wedged inside a pocket, and it would come up with a handful of
      laundry as he went to chuck it into the machine. Whenever this happened,
      Jake would carefully retrieve the black cylinder and tuck it back into the
      bottom corner of his bag. That’s where it belonged. That’s where it
      stayed. For years. It had been so long, he no longer remembered what was
      on the film, what pictures could be frozen there on the tiny strip of
      celluloid. When Maggie died, Jake was lost. He left his job, gave up their
      apartment, packed a few things into his duffle bag, and left town. He gave
      up on himself, letting his hair grow long and his beard grow white. He
      drove the highways aimlessly, stoic behind the wheel of their beloved ‘69
      Charger. Maggie loved that car more than most things and having her gone,
      looking to his right and seeing her seat empty was like a dagger to the
      side every time he looked. In the late afternoons, he could imagine her
      there; small hand hanging out of the window, fingers surfing on the wind.
      He could see the golden light of sunset in her fiery hair, illuminating
      her pale, beautiful face like an angel. If he wanted it badly enough, Jake
      could reach across the seats and take her hand, close his fingers around
      the apparition, feel her close. But when reality returned, it hit hard.
      His tears never seemed to stop, falling hard like a downpour on the
      windshield. The back of his hand wasn’t as efficient as the wipers to
      blast the drops of salty pain away, but it was all he had. When it was
      bad, he pulled over, caution lights blinking on the side of the road until
      the worst was over. Jake stuck to the smaller towns, enjoying the feel of
      an old-timey Main Street. He liked to see the houses built close together,
      their covered porches inviting neighbors and strangers alike to sit and
      talk. He loved the old mom and pop stores, their windows filled with
      enticing seasonal displays. He told the time by these windows, counting
      months with glittered paper shamrocks or tiny American flags. Mostly he
      floated. There was nowhere to be, no destination waiting for him at the
      end of the road. He slept in the car, stretching his long legs across the
      backseat and using her old gray hoodie as a pillow. Her smell had long ago
      faded, but if he tried hard enough, Jake could remember the faint hint of
      coconut that always seemed to spring from her skin. She liked to tease him
      saying that being from Florida meant that everything about her was
      tropical, even her scent. He didn’t care why she smelled like she did,
      what shampoo or lotion combination made her so delicious, he just knew
      that she was. Maggie had been the light of and in his life and now he
      wandered in the shadows without her. At night, with passing headlights
      rolling across the roof, Jake would conjure up a dream of her. It was
      routine now. He started with her hair, that flaming red mess of curls that
      tangled between his fingers, catching even when he tried to be smooth with
      his touches. Her eyes came next, faded denim blue beneath pale lashes that
      were almost blonde in the sunlight. They were his favorite; clear and true
      and filled with nothing but love when they lingered on his face. He’d fall
      asleep like that, imagining her features, recreating her in his mind. Some
      nights she would sneak into his dreams and he’d curl in on himself, loving
      the fantasy. Other times there was nothing behind his eyes, no comforting
      smile, no warm laugh, no touch from her delicate hand. Those nights were
      cold and sleep was far from his grasp. The worst part was, those nights
      were coming more often lately. It seemed harder for him to invoke her
      spirit, to remember the curve of her cheek, the pitch of her nose. Maggie
      was fading away. He worked odd jobs when he felt like it or when his
      wallet was empty and the gas tank was low. He was strong and tall, and
      construction work came easy to him, though there was no passion in it for
      him. It was just a day or two out in the sun, tanning his big arms and
      filling the car back up. A few bosses would ask him to stay on, but he
      never accepted. There were roads left to travel, stars yet to sleep
      beneath. He made a few friends along the way, but none would ever stick;
      it wasn’t worth the effort anyway. He knew he wasn’t good for anything
      without her, wasn’t someone anyone would want to know. He was just a
      traveler now, a ghost like her. The desert was dry and sweat was beading
      on his chest and brow. He beat the drops away but they came right back,
      teasing him like some wicked dream. With the sun bright in the distance,
      he squinted at the road ahead and marveled at the steam coming up from the
      pavement. Heat lines danced before his eyes and the white lines blurred.
      His vision was glossy; his eyes were stinging. Reaching into the backseat,
      Jake dug into the duffle bag and fished around for a clean shirt. He
      needed something to wipe the day away, to clear his head once more before
      the mirage on the side of the road took over. Fumbling, his fingers
      chanced upon the canister and Jake recoiled. He never pulled it out, never
      looked at it lest it disappear forever. His heart was racing, head
      pounding from the heat. He reached again and the film can slipped into his
      palm. His fingers closed around it and Jake brought it out for the first
      time, holding it tight and pressing his fist to his chest. Maggie was
      inside, he knew. Maggie’s gorgeous smile. Her big front teeth and ears
      that stuck out just a bit too much on the tops. Her freckles, her spirit,
      her love. He clutched the can and chewed his lip, biting back the tears,
      fighting the sweat and pain. Two towns later he found a place to develop
      the film and he sat outside on a weather-worn bench, counting down the
      hour in his mind. The street was like a hundred he’d seen; people milling
      about under the mid-morning sky, small storefronts crowded together, their
      colorful awnings shading the sidewalk. It seemed nice, yet like every
      other place: empty without her. When time was up, Jake went back inside,
      ducking beneath the bells that jingled on the door. He thanked the clerk
      and held the envelope tight in his hand. It sat on the passenger's seat as
      he drove away, unopened, the photos unseen. It leaned up against the
      ketchup bottle at the diner as Jake ate his burger, the pictures still a
      mystery. Jake stared at the packet as he sipped his coffee, dragging up
      the will to set the images free. He’d been running from them for so long,
      from the ache of whatever was inside, he was terrified now to open it.
      Afraid he would break down when he saw her face, that he would scream at
      the world around him when her ghost returned, crisp and beautiful, solid
      in his hands. He’d been running too long. He was tired. Jake took a breath
      and opened the envelope, tipping it over to let the photographs spill out
      onto the tabletop. When he looked down, his eyes blurred behind thick
      tears. Every photo was of him. Every snapshot was a random moment he’d
      shared with Maggie, but all from her point of view; all an angle of him.
      His smile, his crooked nose, his shaggy blond hair, his hands, his lips.
      It was all him. For so long, he’d been holding onto her, and all along
      she’d been holding onto him. they had given so much as a penny or a crust
      in ----buried in saipan ----There are still rusted bayonets to be found in
      the dirt. Alongside broken firearms, canteens, and bullet-struck helmets.
      At times, still attached to skeletons. The deep-sea team would
      occasionally find a corroded tank or the remains of a submarine acting as
      an aquarium. Fighter planes would turn up far off in the mountains, a
      surprise to climbers. Rare was it that Hisao found letters buried in
      Saipan. He dropped his shovel and knelt, the archaeology team at work
      behind him—industrial lights illuminated the tunnel with a silver glow.
      Brushing the dirt from his find, Hisao picked up a timeworn book with a
      withered cover. A loose page stuck out from the side. I’m going to
      surrender at dawn… a sentence read. “I got somethi…” Hisao trailed off.
      Curiosity once again bested him. With careful fingers, he opened the book
      and read off the first page. June 2nd, 1944. The Americans can have this
      island, for all I care. I’m tired. We’re spending the day digging trenches
      near the beach. The hot sun beams down on us, and we have little water or
      rice to ration. If we don’t work hard enough, we get shouted at. One word
      out of place and we’re beaten. If there is any silver lining, it is the
      sun’s reflection on the clear waters. The sound of calm waves on the
      shore. Even as bugs swarm me, I cherish the view. It is breathtaking. My
      candlelight fades. This bedroll does little to cushion the dirt. I hope
      the centipedes stay away from me. Hisao turned to the next page. His crew
      continued the work behind him, a wheelbarrow rolling by with crushed rock.
      June 8th, 1944. Mashiro’s playing cards were found. An officer brought him
      outside, and he came back bloodied. I fear this journal will be found as
      well, yet my thoughts are loud, and the nights are quiet. Nothing I write
      in a letter home would make it through censors. June 11th, 1944. I’ve
      never been an accurate shot. The bruises from the cane are still sore—the
      officer threatened to keep rations from all of us unless I improve my aim
      in practice. Another told us we will target the medics when we see them.
      Americans would risk one life to save another. I’m going to falter when
      the time comes. June 13th, 1944 Despite being surrounded by hundreds of my
      brethren, it is very lonely. Not all see the beauty of life as I do. Hisao
      turned the page. The handwriting on the next grew shaky, as if written in
      a hurry. June 15th, 1944 It’s a habit to number the year, even when I have
      doubts I’ll make it to the next one. I’m not going to sleep tonight.
      Warships bombard the shores. Planes drone overhead, the bombs whistle, and
      the grounds tremble. Soon it will be me on the front lines. I fear I don’t
      want I am ready when the time comes. June 17th, 1944 One of the Americans
      is in our captivity. He was shot in the gut. We I dragged him into our
      dugout and bandaged him. The officers will question him come morning. With
      what little English I know, I found time to speak with him. His voice
      shook as we talked, as he hung onto threads of life. I told Alan I grew up
      in a small town in Osaka, while he spoke of Ohio—a sprawling city with
      tall apartments. He would’ve been sent to Germany along with his friends,
      but drew the short end of the stick. He laughed at his joke and I laughed
      too. Alan is asleep now. His breathing fades—I don’t think he’ll wake up.
      I’m glad I could see him smile. June 18th, 1944 The last thing Alan did
      was hand me a letter, asking me to deliver it to his mother in any way I
      could. When I read it over, I could only realize how similar it was to
      mine. It made me question, what am I fighting for? Hisao exhaled, then
      pushed the loose page back into place. June 22nd, 1944 I’m going to
      surrender at dawn. I will fake a stomach problem, then run off. The white
      cloth I carry will state my peace to the Americans. I am terrified. The
      last man to mention the word ‘surrender’ was beaten until he couldn't
      stand, left as an example to us. But I cannot take the trepidation of
      battle any longer. I sit alone with my thoughts until the sun rises.
      Turning one too far, Hisao stared at a blank page. The entries had
      stopped. He turned back to the final one, dated more than a week after the
      last—three days before America claimed their victory. July 6th, 1944 My
      right eye is still blackened—I can no longer see with it. The officer who
      beat me is now leading a reckless charge against the Americans. A final
      stand for control of the island. I, with a few others, am left behind to
      burn our documents in the cave. I will not. Among the documents are
      letters. Dozens. Addressed to families and loved ones. Ones that were
      never sent. Words never spoken. Instead, I shall bury them alongside this
      journal, and hope for it to one day be found. The order then is to take
      our own lives. Grenades have been left for us—we will pull the pin, then
      hold them to our chest. It will be quick and painless. I can only hope,
      that in the afterlife, I am set apart from those who took joy in this
      conflict. Until my words are read, Koji. Hisao sighed. He closed the book,
      then reached for a bag to seal it in. “I found something,” he called. His
      coworkers stepped forward. Hisao handed one the sealed bag, then reached
      in front with both hands. He swept back the dirt, promptly hitting the old
      leather of a satchel. Cameras clicked around him. Another archaeologist
      dropped to help. They pulled the satchel from the ground, and the string
      wrapped around it came loose. Out rained handfuls of letters. ----A Man's
      Man---- They knew I wasn’t cut out for war the moment they stuck an M4
      Carbine in my hands. I had lady fingers while the soldiers around me had
      hands made to strangle and calluses that grated their rifles into
      submission. To die for my country, surrounded by the sweaty men it rounded
      up into its service, was not a lifelong goal of mine. To be fair, I didn’t
      have a lifelong goal. A younger version of myself had been set on teaching
      preschool, or kindergarten—didn’t matter really. I just loved kids. That
      dream was doused by the gaggle of overprotective mothers who had me
      detained at a playground. I had been watching my bi-racial niece with too
      much interest. Her mom wanted a video, and I didn’t think twice; we knew
      mom’s word was law. She hit the zenith of her swing and I captured her
      glee-ridden face as she kicked her legs in a fit of triumph. A lanky brown
      man like me should have known better, should have thought about how I
      looked on the park bench: phone out and a hand in my sweats to keep warm.
      I had mustard on my shirt, too. My niece and I ate hot dogs earlier that
      day and she managed to dapple her pants with ketchup. She wanted to match,
      and I’d obliged. With kids, it’s always about compromise and comradery.
      Out of the moms at the playground, I couldn’t tell you who made the call.
      It might have been a group effort for all I knew, like going to the
      bathroom. But I was twenty with a neckbeard that made me look forty
      and—whoever it was—I understood where they were coming from. Before long,
      an officer stood over me. He’d looked at my skin and that mustard stain
      and my lazy-day sweats, and told me with his eyes that I matched every
      expectation. My only shield from his onslaught of accusations was my niece
      and her big ass tears. He let me walk with a strongly worded suggestion to
      avoid child-related career choices. Four years later, the draft notice hit
      our mailbox. The country had gone above and beyond to provide me a
      minor-free environment. I would have laughed, but my mum was already set
      on crying. I balanced the rifle a healthy distance away from my person and
      didn’t bother to feign comfort. No one expected me to kill anyone anyway,
      but maybe I could block a bullet for someone else. Preferably someone with
      a larger buldge—as the sergeant kindly noted. He said all I needed to do
      was stand still, look pretty, and make sure to wear a condom so I wouldn’t
      risk procreating while getting fucked on the battlefield. I smiled and
      joked and failed at push-ups until the sergeant realized lackluster jabs
      at my genitalia would fall flat. I was no stranger to slander from
      geriatric men. My day job had been in a nursing home, and a low-class one
      at that. A transient friendship formed between myself and the men in my
      company who were able to look beyond my potential as a meat shield. I told
      my niece about them in a letter home. She sent us drawings of dragons and
      horses in response. We named them all with unbridled vulgarity. It felt
      wrong, but it was the good kind of wrong. Not the ending-a-life kind of
      wrong. They came at night—the men we spent six months preparing to
      meet—yipping and yowling in a foreign tongue. I heard the hiss of gunfire,
      dropped the shiny M4, and bolted. Pine trees and soldiers erupted in my
      wake. As I ran, I thought of my mum, and I did not think she would be
      ashamed. But it was my father, not my mum, who had insisted on naming me
      Dick. For a small statured man like myself, it was more of a joke than a
      name. Maybe my father thought my hands and I would grow into it. He hadn’t
      lived long enough to be disappointed when I didn’t. I was told it was a
      car accident, that it happened in an instant, and that he would be here if
      he could. Then, after I hit some inane mark of maturity, my aunty told me
      differently. Got himself stabbed by a mugger, she said. I dug up a news
      clip about it. He had valiantly stepped between the mugger and a lady’s
      purse. The report pegged him as a hero. All I saw was a man who could have
      been a father. An ashamed father, but a father, nevertheless. Had he been
      alive, he would’ve known how to use an M4. And had he been here, watching
      his son run, he might’ve used it to shoot me himself. Some
      adrenaline-inflated part of my brain wanted to laugh at that. The only
      quality time I would spend with my father was if his ghost bit at my
      heels. A fallen log that was more rot than wood served as my shelter that
      night. My unit had been small and there was no point in envisioning our
      future beyond this forest. I pressed myself into the decomposing tree’s
      embrace and wept for the men out there still clutching M4s. How long did
      it take to bleed out? Did it feel longer with pine-needles pressed into
      your neck and terror wheeling above? Would it be an honorable enough end?
      There were soldiers who lived for this moment. The draft was an
      opportunity, they’d said. Perseverance over preservation. Courage over
      cowardice. I saw it in their eyes, in the direction of their boots as they
      stood and wrangled their rifles: one foot in front of the other and you
      could bury your nose in that cut-flower honor our grandpas raised us on.
      Flowers or ashes, both would fill a vase just fine. I wept hardest for
      them. I understood the loss of a dream, but not how a dream could bring
      about so much loss. Those were the sons my father dreamed of when he
      filled out my birth certificate; men who would exchange a purse for a
      life. I wept for myself, too. No matter how you looked at me, I would
      never be a man’s man. I had chosen cowardice over courage, preservation
      over perseverance. Even though I was, chromosomally speaking, born for
      war—I was plagued by fear. I didn’t want to make the wrong choice; I
      didn’t want to die with the ending-a-life kind of wrong in my gut. But
      hundreds of hours with my rifle meant I could hold, aim, and fire the M4
      with ease. The conviction with which I handled the rifle, and the ease
      with which the bullet left the barrel, terrified me. Even a man with lady
      fingers like me could reach through the world and break a mother. A
      trigger didn’t leave room for thought. As dawn came, so too did their
      voices. They spoke amongst themselves, unaware of my presence. It was a
      lyrical language. There were soft consonants and words without edges that
      flowed into one another. I had forgotten the language of our enemy was
      made to string memories together, too. That they had words like ours, for
      kitchen and friend and father. And words that weren’t meant for this
      forest or this war. When they spotted me, their voices transformed, and we
      were on the battlefield once more. But I didn’t have my rifle, and it was
      a small comfort to know that their mothers might hear those soft voices in
      their home again. Dying here, alone and cradled against a reeking log,
      would be an honorable enough end. ---- mythes ---- Everything assumes such
      an immense quality when you are a child. You are a seed amongst the trees
      - waiting, waiting, waiting - for the soil and the sun to open you up, to
      release you from the feeling of smallness. And in that smallness rests
      another seed, one of fear or something like it - a lack of agency and
      hopelessness. My parents were trees. Especially my father. Every morning
      as he would get ready to head into the confiserie, I would sit on the edge
      of the tub and watch him shave. To this day, I cannot feel cold without
      the sour, soapy smell of shaving cream filling my lungs, an association
      unbent by time and experience. He had this way of making everything he did
      seem so big, so important. And my mother. She had this way of approaching
      everything with a preternatural speed. She had a reputation of being the
      best confiseuse in Northern France, but her inborn modesty kept her from
      accepting any compliment. She broke so easily - at least that was what my
      father would come to say - yet she stood the tallest despite the weather.
      The first eight years of my life were relatively soundless. If I were to
      go back and throw a ball of yarn against my bedroom window, I probably
      would have been able to hear it. My parents used to rise together at the
      faintest hint of dawn and sip coffee, Mother with a novel and Father with
      Le Parisien, occasionally locking eyes as if to say, "Mon dieu, je t'aime
      tellement." I would watch this from the thin crack of my bedroom door and
      inhale their light as if to retain it forever, not knowing that it was a
      fruitless task, for soon after my ninth birthday there was no light left,
      only rough blue dark that filled my lungs like fiberglass. My parents’
      confiserie was among the oldest in Old Paris, inherited as it were from my
      namesake, Grandpère Julian, my father’s father. It was once said that I
      was born in the shop, my mother heaving me out of her amongst the almonds
      and fruits and sugars. It was just the first of many family myths that I
      had learned to entertain and then quickly dismiss: Julian, you are part
      sugar. In any case, I grew up there. If I wasn’t in school or at home, I
      was sitting at one of the few tables that lined the windows of the shop,
      eating raspberry guimauves and reading. My mother spent most of her days
      in the kitchen whipping and whisking and slicing, stopping only to deliver
      trays of fresh sweets to my father, who would then arrange them in the
      cases with admirable precision. She might pause briefly to kiss him, or to
      ensure that I was keeping up with my studies (all she had to do was raise
      a brow if I met her gaze). My father would tend to the patrons; that was
      what he did best. He never seemed to tire of boxing up têtes de chocolat
      and placing sucettes in children’s palms and chatting with the regulars
      over le chocolat chaud. Occasionally he would have me help fill larger
      orders, paying me with another guimauve. He would wink at me as if to say,
      “Don’t tell your mother.” I smiled then, because I thought that would be
      the first and only secret between us. It wasn’t. I wish I could go back
      and erase that smile off my sticky face, as if to tell him that I wanted
      no part of it - any of it: the guimauves and his drinking and his women
      (right now, imagine the sound of your most favorite song ending -
      forever). This leads me to the second family myth: Love is always enough.
      Sometimes I think about what would have been different about my life had I
      kept believing that, instead of being a child who realized that his
      parents manufactured false truths right before his too-trusting eyes. The
      first time I heard my mother weep because of my father (right now, imagine
      the sensation of coughing up a knife), I was an inch shy of nine and
      learning long division. Irony tastes no different to me than my mother’s
      pastilles du mineur - hard and black and terrifying. Which brings me to
      the third family myth: Sugar is always sweet. I just sat at my rickety
      table and pressed my pencil so hard into my notebook as if to signal to
      them that my little world had been reduced to making sense of problems
      that cannot be solved. Yet she continued to cry and eventually he would
      leave, only to stumble home at the smallest hour of night smelling of
      something I wouldn’t come to recognize until I was much older: sex and
      regret and more sex. Sometimes I wish I could have leveraged my smallness
      to my advantage. When you are small, you have more power than you know to
      augment your reality. I would have shrunken myself into the tiniest common
      denominator and crept into my mother’s cocons, breathing in their musky
      sweet smell and breathing out my parents’ old light, dead and yellow and
      broken. Or I would have made myself small enough to rest my head on her
      Coussins de Lyon - tiny teal cushions that could have carried me into
      sleep instead of leading me from it (right now, imagine the darkest of
      dark things clawing at you, leaving bloody lines down your back). The back
      door of our kitchen led to a magasin de papier. Sometimes, when either
      their yelling or their silence became too much, I would click open the
      doorknob (right now, imagine the sound your heart might make if it woke up
      after a thousand-year sleep), and Mdme. Laurent would say, “Bonjour,
      Julian!” in a way that my mother never had, and she would tousle my hair
      and show me her newest calligraphy sets. By the time I was sixteen, she
      had stopped pretending that I was a boy, but I didn’t. I think about the
      sweetness of Mdme’s mouth, and how I wish I would have captured it in a
      confection, though I wouldn’t have called it "‘Mdme’s Mouth," but rather
      "Love or Something Like It." I think about my parents’ bitter tongues, and
      how I wish I would have captured it in a confection, if only so they could
      know what it had been like for me as a boy; to be deceived and
      subsequently disappointed, ill. I don’t know what I would have called it,
      though. Sometimes there are no words, just feelings. Sometimes I think
      about my daughter’s smallness and if she ever wishes to be a tree. And how
      I wish she didn’t view me as a tree because that is such a thing to live
      up to: damn near indestructible and also so fragile (right now, imagine
      your mother’s smallest voice and how sometimes it sounds like branches
      cracking, but other times it sounds like nothing). Everything assumes such
      a small quality when you are approaching death. You are a tree amongst the
      seeds - waiting, waiting, waiting - for the soil and the sun to dry you
      up, to release you from the feeling of immensity. And in that smallness
      rests another seed, one of calm or something like it - an abundance of
      agency and hope. ---- seedling ---- The light bulb flickered, humming to a
      dim glow in the sitting room of Symon Shevchenko’s farmhouse. He had
      refused to leave. He had lived in that house his entire life, born there,
      his father born there; he was too old, he told the mayor, to pick up and
      come to town with everyone else. What would he do there? He is farmer. He
      does not know how to live in a small apartment, surrounded by concrete. If
      the darkness decided to envelope him, so be it. He picked up a tattered
      copy of Gogol’s Dead Souls, put on his reading glasses, and settled into
      his favorite chair to read. And wait. For three weeks, the darkness had
      been encroaching upon the village. No one noticed at first as it swallowed
      the deeper forest, taking with it the elk, the deer, the wild boar, the
      hare. Then it obliterated the stream that fed their wells, along with the
      perch and the sturgeon. When the farms on the furthest outskirts
      disappeared, along with their livestock, their families, then the people
      started to notice, and talk. “Have you been out to the Abramov farm?” A
      middle-aged woman clutched her handbag and held her jacket closed at the
      collar. “There is nothing there. Just dark fog.” She looked over her
      shoulder as if the darkness was listening. “Why would I go out there?
      Oksana, leave the outskirts to the soldiers. There is nothing we can do.”
      Alyona shook her head and made the sign of the cross. A truck rumbled by
      loaded with cables, towing floodlights and a generator. The driver
      acknowledged the women as he sped past, the engine grinding into high
      gear. “More lights,” Alyona commented as she watched the work truck lurch
      toward the farm lands. “With God’s blessings, may it work.” The
      electrician had volunteered for this. He knew how to lay cable, to make
      sure the circuits could distribute the load without tripping a breaker.
      Soldiers had been deployed to implement the emergency plan, but lighting
      up the entire border was a monumental effort that taxed the military’s
      resources. Every able-bodied person was asked to help, implored to help,
      and electricians were hailed as heroes for their knowledge. They arrived
      at Symon Shevchenko’s farm in the middle of the afternoon; they had ample
      time to place the generators and lay cable before the sun would relinquish
      its place and allow the darkness to seep in from the north. Maxim jumped
      off the truck and scanned the fields, the farmer’s young crops, the
      neighbor’s house in the distance, and the black, impenetrable fog that
      hovered behind a grove of trees, waiting for its opportunity to expand. To
      the west he could see the generators and floodlights his team had placed
      yesterday. The empty nothingness silently churning outside of their reach
      dwarfed the lights and stretched the limits of his ability to hope. He
      shook off his gloomy thoughts and got to work. One more farm to save, or
      at least stave off the disappearing long enough for someone to figure it
      out. Andriy was already staking out where the equipment would go. Maxim
      hustled to give him a hand. “What are you thinking—fifty meters from the
      darkness?” Maxim eyeballed the distance to the dark edge of the opaque
      black fog. Andriy looked over his shoulder, toward the floodlights placed
      yesterday. “It seemed to work over there,” he glanced up at Maxim as he
      nodded toward the last farm. “I can still see the Melnyk farm.” He dug
      into the soil, and placed a bright orange marker. Symon looked up from his
      book and watched the crews setting up the enormous lights. He was
      interrupted by a knock at the door. “Sir, we’re setting up the generator a
      little ways off the back of your house,” the young soldier was in full
      combat gear, covered in a fine layer of Symon’s topsoil. “You’ll need to
      listen for it throughout the night. If it stops running, if you have any
      concerns, light a flare—” he held one up to make the point, then offered
      Symon a bag of six. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to come to town? It’s
      safer there.” Symon smiled at the soldier, that smile old people make when
      they don’t want to hear good advice from a young person. How old is he,
      19, maybe 20? Not much older than my grandson. “Thank you, I’ll be fine
      here.” He patted the young man on the forearm and accepted the bag of
      flares. “Okay, well, we have guards watching all night. If you have any
      concerns, just light a flare and we’ll come.” Symon nodded and shut the
      door. The sun was beginning its final descent, perfectly framed in the
      lower half of one casement window. Symon considered it, how beautiful the
      sunset is, then headed to the kitchen to make dinner. The generator roared
      to life. The lights overwhelmed the dying day and glared in at him. The
      generator was the only sound now. With the darkness came silence, because
      nothing lived in that black fog. At least, nothing living had ever come
      out of it, and the darkness had never retreated to reveal what it might
      leave behind. Symon had heard scientists were monitoring it, and there
      were reports of kids who dared each other to touch it, enter it. I think
      that’s how Krystiyan’s grandkid disappeared. He put a frozen dinner in the
      microwave. The last red-orange hues of the day rested on the horizon as
      deep purples streaked the sky from the east, but Symon’s house was lit
      from the outside by the harsh manufactured glow. He took a few bites of
      dinner but he wasn’t really hungry. He put down his fork, and looked out
      the kitchen window: what’s in there? What does it feel like, that black
      fog? He understood the curiosity of the children, at the same time he knew
      that the question could be answered definitively only once. The generator
      hummed in the background. He got up from the table, leaving his plate
      where it sat, and walked to the back door. The old brass doorknob felt
      cold in his hand. He opened it, surprised at how loud the squeak from the
      hinges sounded when there were no crickets, no wolves, no owls singing
      their evening ballads. Symon stepped outside into the cool air. Darkness
      on the farm was not unusual, but this darkness obliterated even the
      outlines of trees. There was nothing beyond the black fog, nothing above
      it, certainly nothing hinted at its base. It was as if some force had
      built a massive wall, a curtain, to hide what had always been there, or to
      take it for itself. And each day it stole a little bit more. He walked
      across the yard, past his barn, the engine of the generator louder with
      each step. But it was not a welcome respite from the silence. On the
      contrary, it seemed to amplify it. There was no other noise. He thrust his
      hands in his pockets as he walked, checking on his cows and goats who
      calmly chewed their roughage, oblivious to the danger. For a brief moment,
      life felt normal. He left the animals’ pens and strode the few feet to the
      edge of the manmade illumination. Symon was dwarfed by the poles holding
      the 400-watt lamps, and the lamps were dwarfed by the roiling black wall
      of fog they held back. He looked up; the fog billowed out and disappeared
      as it hit the light. He looked left and right; as far as he could see, the
      darkness tested the light’s edge, and disappeared as it hit the artificial
      glow. Symon walked as closely as he could, peering into it, trying to see
      something beyond the billowing surface. Like the rebel pre-teens scolded
      by the soldiers, he reached his hand toward the darkness, slowly. He
      twisted his hand as he watched it fade from sight, first his fingers, then
      the back of his thumb, then his wrist. It felt like nothing, vaguely cold,
      but neither comforting nor painful. He pulled his hand back, and studied
      it, stretching his fingers, making a fist. Hm, my joints seem to ache
      less, and he looked at his other hand, performing the same maneuvers. His
      fingers stiff with the dull pains of age and use reminded him of the years
      of hard labor coaxing food from the soil. I wonder. . . he extended his
      second hand into the black fog bank, and watched it disappear like the
      first. He withdrew it, and flexed his fingers. No pain. “Huh,” he
      inspected his hands as if they belonged to some other creature, then
      looked up at the darkness. He stood there for a moment, contemplating the
      pros and cons of testing the fog further. If he entered, could he could
      come back out? Would the stiffness of age, the old injuries of youth, be
      gone? Symon walked within the protection of the light along the edge of
      the black fog and ran his fingers through it, the way a dog sticks its
      nose out of the truck’s window, enjoying the breeze. He walked a kilometer
      or more, to the edge of the Malnyk farm, when he noticed a spot of
      brightness in the haze. The darkness had obscured part of Malnyk’s fields,
      specifically where he grew sunflowers. The plants were tiny shoots planted
      just recently, no more than squat stems with two embryonic cotyledon
      leaves. Some of the plants had been trampled by the earnest work crews
      placing lights. Those that survived under the lights were spindly, likes
      plants grown in a lit greenhouse. But at the foot of the darkness, where
      nothing was alive, not even grasses, Symon Shevchenko could see a faint
      green luminescence. “What is this?” he muttered under his breath as he
      knelt down to inspect the shock of color. Along the dense, misty edge of
      the darkness, small seedlings radiated a faint green glow, like
      phosphorescent mushrooms or bugs. The seedlings had each carved a small
      clearing in the fog, like little lanterns of their own making, lighting
      the radius of their leaves. Symon looked along the length of the planted
      row. He could see little circles of green light reaching into the depths
      of the darkness, each less intense than the one in front of it, little
      beacons marching against the gloom. Symon reached down and gently touched
      the leaves of the seedling just inside the edge of the fog. It felt strong
      and vibrant. The embryonic leaves were thick, dark green, with tiny white
      hairs like an old man’s unshaven face, or the crown of a newborn babe. But
      nothing else grew. No animals or insects dared to nibble on the fresh
      shoots that fought against the darkness. No weeds crowded them. Symon
      stood and pondered his discovery—why hasn’t someone noticed this? He rose
      and dusted the dirt from his hands and walked back home. His footsteps on
      the soil kept a beat for the generators’ constant hum. Symon glanced
      across his land that still lay untouched by the darkness. The work crew
      was out with the morning sun measuring new encroachments made by the
      darkness overnight. Symon completed his morning chores, fed his animals,
      checked his fields. He decided to go check on Malnyk’s sunflowers again.
      The sky to the south was bright blue. The sounds of tractors, chickens,
      sheep and goats replaced the hum of generators. To the north, the darkness
      was as impenetrable as the day before. Symon walked along its edge,
      greeting the soldiers and volunteers who were out checking and
      double-checking the cables, generators and lamps. As he approached
      Malnyk’s farm, he slowed and surveyed the field. Sunflowers are hardy
      plants, and in spite of the extra foot traffic, the crop seemed to have
      recovered. He stopped at one row, and ran his eyes along its length, from
      where it began perpendicular to the dirt road, to where it disappeared
      into the darkness. He turned and followed it, right up to the churning
      blackness. He scanned the wall of billowing black fog; it didn’t look any
      different now than it did during the night. He turned and squinted at the
      sun, grateful to have its protection. Just like the night before, he bent
      down and looked at the seedlings. It was much more obvious, when the only
      darkness was the unnatural evil descending from the north, that the tiny
      sunflower seedling had carved a small space free from the taint. It was
      hard to verify, but it seemed to Symon that the sunflower seedlings
      continued to break the darkness as the row disappeared into the fog. A
      soldier came by with a wheelbarrow full of electrical gear. “Do you need
      some help, old-timer?” “No, no, just checking my neighbor’s crops,” Symon
      shook his head and smiled at the young man. Then he headed home. He had an
      idea, and needed help. He waved to the crew checking his generator as he
      strode past. He grabbed the keys for his old truck and headed to town. He
      needed to tell his friends and the other farmers what he found. He pulled
      up to a diner and parked next to Mykola’s truck. A number of old farmers,
      men and women, sat at a table discussing the developments of the night.
      They waved Symon over when he entered. He signaled the waitress for a cup
      of coffee, and told them what he had seen. “You’re saying the sunflower
      seedlings beat back the darkness?” Zlata knit her brow. She had seen the
      black fog destroy half her farm, and take her dog too. “Do you think
      anything else is alive in there?” “All I could see were the seedlings,”
      Symon replied. “There were not even weeds growing with them, no bugs on
      the leaves.” “And it felt like . . .nothing?” Dmytro leaned in, and pushed
      back the brim of his cap. The table of farmers was joined by others,
      people who formed the foundation of the town, grandmothers and
      grandfathers, great aunts and great uncles. They stayed well past noon,
      the meals changed from breakfast to lunch, a few happily claiming they had
      earned their early beers after staying up with the generators the night
      before. “So it’s settled,” Symon smiled at his table of friends, and every
      face smiled back, nodding in agreement. Late afternoon, the young soldier
      knocked on Symon’s door. “Hello, sir. I just wanted to make sure you have
      those flares I gave you yesterday.” Symon smiled and nodded. “Are you sure
      we can’t take you to town?” “No, no, I will be alright. This is my home! I
      am not afraid of the darkness.” The young soldier nodded deferentially and
      walked back to his truck. The sunset was particularly beautiful, framed in
      the sitting room window, every shade of crimson below, the radiant deep
      blue of evening settling in from above. The generators hummed to life.
      Symon put down his book, took off his reading glasses, and headed for the
      door. At the barn, he picked up a large burlap sack full of sunflower
      seeds and hooked the strap over his shoulder. He walked to the back of his
      property, where the dark fog toiled and curled, raging against the wall of
      light. He was joined by another farmer, and then another, until everyone
      who was at the diner, plus others who had heard the story, stood at the
      edge of the light, at the edge of the darkness, each with their own sacks
      of seeds hung from their shoulders. They spread out, laughing and talking
      as they each took up a spot along the edge of the fog. “For our town,”
      shouted one man. “For our children,” shouted another. “For our children’s
      children,” echoed across the fields. They turned and smiled at each other,
      grabbing handfuls of seed. “Glory be forever!” They walked into the fog,
      sowing sunflower seeds as far as their arms could fling them. The grim
      soldiers continued their work fighting off the darkness. The young man had
      knocked at Symon Shevchenko’s door, but did not receive an answer. He
      tipped his head, his helmet hiding his face, and returned to the
      generator. Maxim was preparing to lay cable at another farm when he
      realized he was too far away. “Andriy, did you check distance? We’re too
      far.” The light standards placed yesterday were more than fifty meters
      from the black fog. Maxim eyed the churning blackness, and looked down the
      long line of lights placed over the previous weeks. All of them were too
      far. Confusion on his face, he decided to walk off the distance, taking
      meter-long strides toward the darkness. He confirmed the fifty-meter mark
      was no longer near the edge. In its place was a field of tiny sunflower
      shoots, strong and healthy, no weeds, no insects. He walked a few meters
      into the seedlings up to the edge of the darkness, and saw that small
      patches of green light continued into the diminishing black fog. Within a
      month, the darkness had been pushed back and reduced, replaced by an
      endless sea of sunflower stalks, their green flowerheads watching the sun.
      By the end of summer, they towered above the town folks’ heads, filling in
      the space beneath the trees with their bright yellow faces, and the
      darkness surrendered its last hold.
