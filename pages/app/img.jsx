        ----unseen---- The canister had always been there, rolling around at the
        bottom of his duffle bag. Whenever he packed, his fingers would graze
        over the smooth, gray top, but he’d never take it out, never look
        directly at it. Sometimes when he unpacked, the canister would get wound
        up in a dirty sock or wedged inside a pocket, and it would come up with
        a handful of laundry as he went to chuck it into the machine. Whenever
        this happened, Jake would carefully retrieve the black cylinder and tuck
        it back into the bottom corner of his bag. That’s where it belonged.
        That’s where it stayed. For years. It had been so long, he no longer
        remembered what was on the film, what pictures could be frozen there on
        the tiny strip of celluloid. When Maggie died, Jake was lost. He left
        his job, gave up their apartment, packed a few things into his duffle
        bag, and left town. He gave up on himself, letting his hair grow long
        and his beard grow white. He drove the highways aimlessly, stoic behind
        the wheel of their beloved ‘69 Charger. Maggie loved that car more than
        most things and having her gone, looking to his right and seeing her
        seat empty was like a dagger to the side every time he looked. In the
        late afternoons, he could imagine her there; small hand hanging out of
        the window, fingers surfing on the wind. He could see the golden light
        of sunset in her fiery hair, illuminating her pale, beautiful face like
        an angel. If he wanted it badly enough, Jake could reach across the
        seats and take her hand, close his fingers around the apparition, feel
        her close. But when reality returned, it hit hard. His tears never
        seemed to stop, falling hard like a downpour on the windshield. The back
        of his hand wasn’t as efficient as the wipers to blast the drops of
        salty pain away, but it was all he had. When it was bad, he pulled over,
        caution lights blinking on the side of the road until the worst was
        over. Jake stuck to the smaller towns, enjoying the feel of an old-timey
        Main Street. He liked to see the houses built close together, their
        covered porches inviting neighbors and strangers alike to sit and talk.
        He loved the old mom and pop stores, their windows filled with enticing
        seasonal displays. He told the time by these windows, counting months
        with glittered paper shamrocks or tiny American flags. Mostly he
        floated. There was nowhere to be, no destination waiting for him at the
        end of the road. He slept in the car, stretching his long legs across
        the backseat and using her old gray hoodie as a pillow. Her smell had
        long ago faded, but if he tried hard enough, Jake could remember the
        faint hint of coconut that always seemed to spring from her skin. She
        liked to tease him saying that being from Florida meant that everything
        about her was tropical, even her scent. He didn’t care why she smelled
        like she did, what shampoo or lotion combination made her so delicious,
        he just knew that she was. Maggie had been the light of and in his life
        and now he wandered in the shadows without her. At night, with passing
        headlights rolling across the roof, Jake would conjure up a dream of
        her. It was routine now. He started with her hair, that flaming red mess
        of curls that tangled between his fingers, catching even when he tried
        to be smooth with his touches. Her eyes came next, faded denim blue
        beneath pale lashes that were almost blonde in the sunlight. They were
        his favorite; clear and true and filled with nothing but love when they
        lingered on his face. He’d fall asleep like that, imagining her
        features, recreating her in his mind. Some nights she would sneak into
        his dreams and he’d curl in on himself, loving the fantasy. Other times
        there was nothing behind his eyes, no comforting smile, no warm laugh,
        no touch from her delicate hand. Those nights were cold and sleep was
        far from his grasp. The worst part was, those nights were coming more
        often lately. It seemed harder for him to invoke her spirit, to remember
        the curve of her cheek, the pitch of her nose. Maggie was fading away.
        He worked odd jobs when he felt like it or when his wallet was empty and
        the gas tank was low. He was strong and tall, and construction work came
        easy to him, though there was no passion in it for him. It was just a
        day or two out in the sun, tanning his big arms and filling the car back
        up. A few bosses would ask him to stay on, but he never accepted. There
        were roads left to travel, stars yet to sleep beneath. He made a few
        friends along the way, but none would ever stick; it wasn’t worth the
        effort anyway. He knew he wasn’t good for anything without her, wasn’t
        someone anyone would want to know. He was just a traveler now, a ghost
        like her. The desert was dry and sweat was beading on his chest and
        brow. He beat the drops away but they came right back, teasing him like
        some wicked dream. With the sun bright in the distance, he squinted at
        the road ahead and marveled at the steam coming up from the pavement.
        Heat lines danced before his eyes and the white lines blurred. His
        vision was glossy; his eyes were stinging. Reaching into the backseat,
        Jake dug into the duffle bag and fished around for a clean shirt. He
        needed something to wipe the day away, to clear his head once more
        before the mirage on the side of the road took over. Fumbling, his
        fingers chanced upon the canister and Jake recoiled. He never pulled it
        out, never looked at it lest it disappear forever. His heart was racing,
        head pounding from the heat. He reached again and the film can slipped
        into his palm. His fingers closed around it and Jake brought it out for
        the first time, holding it tight and pressing his fist to his chest.
        Maggie was inside, he knew. Maggie’s gorgeous smile. Her big front teeth
        and ears that stuck out just a bit too much on the tops. Her freckles,
        her spirit, her love. He clutched the can and chewed his lip, biting
        back the tears, fighting the sweat and pain. Two towns later he found a
        place to develop the film and he sat outside on a weather-worn bench,
        counting down the hour in his mind. The street was like a hundred he’d
        seen; people milling about under the mid-morning sky, small storefronts
        crowded together, their colorful awnings shading the sidewalk. It seemed
        nice, yet like every other place: empty without her. When time was up,
        Jake went back inside, ducking beneath the bells that jingled on the
        door. He thanked the clerk and held the envelope tight in his hand. It
        sat on the passenger's seat as he drove away, unopened, the photos
        unseen. It leaned up against the ketchup bottle at the diner as Jake ate
        his burger, the pictures still a mystery. Jake stared at the packet as
        he sipped his coffee, dragging up the will to set the images free. He’d
        been running from them for so long, from the ache of whatever was
        inside, he was terrified now to open it. Afraid he would break down when
        he saw her face, that he would scream at the world around him when her
        ghost returned, crisp and beautiful, solid in his hands. He’d been
        running too long. He was tired. Jake took a breath and opened the
        envelope, tipping it over to let the photographs spill out onto the
        tabletop. When he looked down, his eyes blurred behind thick tears.
        Every photo was of him. Every snapshot was a random moment he’d shared
        with Maggie, but all from her point of view; all an angle of him. His
        smile, his crooked nose, his shaggy blond hair, his hands, his lips. It
        was all him. For so long, he’d been holding onto her, and all along
        she’d been holding onto him. they had given so much as a penny or a
        crust in ----buried in saipan ----There are still rusted bayonets to be
        found in the dirt. Alongside broken firearms, canteens, and
        bullet-struck helmets. At times, still attached to skeletons. The
        deep-sea team would occasionally find a corroded tank or the remains of
        a submarine acting as an aquarium. Fighter planes would turn up far off
        in the mountains, a surprise to climbers. Rare was it that Hisao found
        letters buried in Saipan. He dropped his shovel and knelt, the
        archaeology team at work behind him—industrial lights illuminated the
        tunnel with a silver glow. Brushing the dirt from his find, Hisao picked
        up a timeworn book with a withered cover. A loose page stuck out from
        the side. I’m going to surrender at dawn… a sentence read. “I got
        somethi…” Hisao trailed off. Curiosity once again bested him. With
        careful fingers, he opened the book and read off the first page. June
        2nd, 1944. The Americans can have this island, for all I care. I’m
        tired. We’re spending the day digging trenches near the beach. The hot
        sun beams down on us, and we have little water or rice to ration. If we
        don’t work hard enough, we get shouted at. One word out of place and
        we’re beaten. If there is any silver lining, it is the sun’s reflection
        on the clear waters. The sound of calm waves on the shore. Even as bugs
        swarm me, I cherish the view. It is breathtaking. My candlelight fades.
        This bedroll does little to cushion the dirt. I hope the centipedes stay
        away from me. Hisao turned to the next page. His crew continued the work
        behind him, a wheelbarrow rolling by with crushed rock. June 8th, 1944.
        Mashiro’s playing cards were found. An officer brought him outside, and
        he came back bloodied. I fear this journal will be found as well, yet my
        thoughts are loud, and the nights are quiet. Nothing I write in a letter
        home would make it through censors. June 11th, 1944. I’ve never been an
        accurate shot. The bruises from the cane are still sore—the officer
        threatened to keep rations from all of us unless I improve my aim in
        practice. Another told us we will target the medics when we see them.
        Americans would risk one life to save another. I’m going to falter when
        the time comes. June 13th, 1944 Despite being surrounded by hundreds of
        my brethren, it is very lonely. Not all see the beauty of life as I do.
        Hisao turned the page. The handwriting on the next grew shaky, as if
        written in a hurry. June 15th, 1944 It’s a habit to number the year,
        even when I have doubts I’ll make it to the next one. I’m not going to
        sleep tonight. Warships bombard the shores. Planes drone overhead, the
        bombs whistle, and the grounds tremble. Soon it will be me on the front
        lines. I fear I don’t want I am ready when the time comes. June 17th,
        1944 One of the Americans is in our captivity. He was shot in the gut.
        We I dragged him into our dugout and bandaged him. The officers will
        question him come morning. With what little English I know, I found time
        to speak with him. His voice shook as we talked, as he hung onto threads
        of life. I told Alan I grew up in a small town in Osaka, while he spoke
        of Ohio—a sprawling city with tall apartments. He would’ve been sent to
        Germany along with his friends, but drew the short end of the stick. He
        laughed at his joke and I laughed too. Alan is asleep now. His breathing
        fades—I don’t think he’ll wake up. I’m glad I could see him smile. June
        18th, 1944 The last thing Alan did was hand me a letter, asking me to
        deliver it to his mother in any way I could. When I read it over, I
        could only realize how similar it was to mine. It made me question, what
        am I fighting for? Hisao exhaled, then pushed the loose page back into
        place. June 22nd, 1944 I’m going to surrender at dawn. I will fake a
        stomach problem, then run off. The white cloth I carry will state my
        peace to the Americans. I am terrified. The last man to mention the word
        ‘surrender’ was beaten until he couldn't stand, left as an example to
        us. But I cannot take the trepidation of battle any longer. I sit alone
        with my thoughts until the sun rises. Turning one too far, Hisao stared
        at a blank page. The entries had stopped. He turned back to the final
        one, dated more than a week after the last—three days before America
        claimed their victory. July 6th, 1944 My right eye is still blackened—I
        can no longer see with it. The officer who beat me is now leading a
        reckless charge against the Americans. A final stand for control of the
        island. I, with a few others, am left behind to burn our documents in
        the cave. I will not. Among the documents are letters. Dozens. Addressed
        to families and loved ones. Ones that were never sent. Words never
        spoken. Instead, I shall bury them alongside this journal, and hope for
        it to one day be found. The order then is to take our own lives.
        Grenades have been left for us—we will pull the pin, then hold them to
        our chest. It will be quick and painless. I can only hope, that in the
        afterlife, I am set apart from those who took joy in this conflict.
        Until my words are read, Koji. Hisao sighed. He closed the book, then
        reached for a bag to seal it in. “I found something,” he called. His
        coworkers stepped forward. Hisao handed one the sealed bag, then reached
        in front with both hands. He swept back the dirt, promptly hitting the
        old leather of a satchel. Cameras clicked around him. Another
        archaeologist dropped to help. They pulled the satchel from the ground,
        and the string wrapped around it came loose. Out rained handfuls of
        letters. ----A Man's Man---- They knew I wasn’t cut out for war the
        moment they stuck an M4 Carbine in my hands. I had lady fingers while
        the soldiers around me had hands made to strangle and calluses that
        grated their rifles into submission. To die for my country, surrounded
        by the sweaty men it rounded up into its service, was not a lifelong
        goal of mine. To be fair, I didn’t have a lifelong goal. A younger
        version of myself had been set on teaching preschool, or
        kindergarten—didn’t matter really. I just loved kids. That dream was
        doused by the gaggle of overprotective mothers who had me detained at a
        playground. I had been watching my bi-racial niece with too much
        interest. Her mom wanted a video, and I didn’t think twice; we knew
        mom’s word was law. She hit the zenith of her swing and I captured her
        glee-ridden face as she kicked her legs in a fit of triumph. A lanky
        brown man like me should have known better, should have thought about
        how I looked on the park bench: phone out and a hand in my sweats to
        keep warm. I had mustard on my shirt, too. My niece and I ate hot dogs
        earlier that day and she managed to dapple her pants with ketchup. She
        wanted to match, and I’d obliged. With kids, it’s always about
        compromise and comradery. Out of the moms at the playground, I couldn’t
        tell you who made the call. It might have been a group effort for all I
        knew, like going to the bathroom. But I was twenty with a neckbeard that
        made me look forty and—whoever it was—I understood where they were
        coming from. Before long, an officer stood over me. He’d looked at my
        skin and that mustard stain and my lazy-day sweats, and told me with his
        eyes that I matched every expectation. My only shield from his onslaught
        of accusations was my niece and her big ass tears. He let me walk with a
        strongly worded suggestion to avoid child-related career choices. Four
        years later, the draft notice hit our mailbox. The country had gone
        above and beyond to provide me a minor-free environment. I would have
        laughed, but my mum was already set on crying. I balanced the rifle a
        healthy distance away from my person and didn’t bother to feign comfort.
        No one expected me to kill anyone anyway, but maybe I could block a
        bullet for someone else. Preferably someone with a larger buldge—as the
        sergeant kindly noted. He said all I needed to do was stand still, look
        pretty, and make sure to wear a condom so I wouldn’t risk procreating
        while getting fucked on the battlefield. I smiled and joked and failed
        at push-ups until the sergeant realized lackluster jabs at my genitalia
        would fall flat. I was no stranger to slander from geriatric men. My day
        job had been in a nursing home, and a low-class one at that. A transient
        friendship formed between myself and the men in my company who were able
        to look beyond my potential as a meat shield. I told my niece about them
        in a letter home. She sent us drawings of dragons and horses in
        response. We named them all with unbridled vulgarity. It felt wrong, but
        it was the good kind of wrong. Not the ending-a-life kind of wrong. They
        came at night—the men we spent six months preparing to meet—yipping and
        yowling in a foreign tongue. I heard the hiss of gunfire, dropped the
        shiny M4, and bolted. Pine trees and soldiers erupted in my wake. As I
        ran, I thought of my mum, and I did not think she would be ashamed. But
        it was my father, not my mum, who had insisted on naming me Dick. For a
        small statured man like myself, it was more of a joke than a name. Maybe
        my father thought my hands and I would grow into it. He hadn’t lived
        long enough to be disappointed when I didn’t. I was told it was a car
        accident, that it happened in an instant, and that he would be here if
        he could. Then, after I hit some inane mark of maturity, my aunty told
        me differently. Got himself stabbed by a mugger, she said. I dug up a
        news clip about it. He had valiantly stepped between the mugger and a
        lady’s purse. The report pegged him as a hero. All I saw was a man who
        could have been a father. An ashamed father, but a father, nevertheless.
        Had he been alive, he would’ve known how to use an M4. And had he been
        here, watching his son run, he might’ve used it to shoot me himself.
        Some adrenaline-inflated part of my brain wanted to laugh at that. The
        only quality time I would spend with my father was if his ghost bit at
        my heels. A fallen log that was more rot than wood served as my shelter
        that night. My unit had been small and there was no point in envisioning
        our future beyond this forest. I pressed myself into the decomposing
        tree’s embrace and wept for the men out there still clutching M4s. How
        long did it take to bleed out? Did it feel longer with pine-needles
        pressed into your neck and terror wheeling above? Would it be an
        honorable enough end? There were soldiers who lived for this moment. The
        draft was an opportunity, they’d said. Perseverance over preservation.
        Courage over cowardice. I saw it in their eyes, in the direction of
        their boots as they stood and wrangled their rifles: one foot in front
        of the other and you could bury your nose in that cut-flower honor our
        grandpas raised us on. Flowers or ashes, both would fill a vase just
        fine. I wept hardest for them. I understood the loss of a dream, but not
        how a dream could bring about so much loss. Those were the sons my
        father dreamed of when he filled out my birth certificate; men who would
        exchange a purse for a life. I wept for myself, too. No matter how you
        looked at me, I would never be a man’s man. I had chosen cowardice over
        courage, preservation over perseverance. Even though I was,
        chromosomally speaking, born for war—I was plagued by fear. I didn’t
        want to make the wrong choice; I didn’t want to die with the
        ending-a-life kind of wrong in my gut. But hundreds of hours with my
        rifle meant I could hold, aim, and fire the M4 with ease. The conviction
        with which I handled the rifle, and the ease with which the bullet left
        the barrel, terrified me. Even a man with lady fingers like me could
        reach through the world and break a mother. A trigger didn’t leave room
        for thought. As dawn came, so too did their voices. They spoke amongst
        themselves, unaware of my presence. It was a lyrical language. There
        were soft consonants and words without edges that flowed into one
        another. I had forgotten the language of our enemy was made to string
        memories together, too. That they had words like ours, for kitchen and
        friend and father. And words that weren’t meant for this forest or this
        war. When they spotted me, their voices transformed, and we were on the
        battlefield once more. But I didn’t have my rifle, and it was a small
        comfort to know that their mothers might hear those soft voices in their
        home again. Dying here, alone and cradled against a reeking log, would
        be an honorable enough end. ---- mythes ---- Everything assumes such an
        immense quality when you are a child. You are a seed amongst the trees -
        waiting, waiting, waiting - for the soil and the sun to open you up, to
        release you from the feeling of smallness. And in that smallness rests
        another seed, one of fear or something like it - a lack of agency and
        hopelessness. My parents were trees. Especially my father. Every morning
        as he would get ready to head into the confiserie, I would sit on the
        edge of the tub and watch him shave. To this day, I cannot feel cold
        without the sour, soapy smell of shaving cream filling my lungs, an
        association unbent by time and experience. He had this way of making
        everything he did seem so big, so important. And my mother. She had this
        way of approaching everything with a preternatural speed. She had a
        reputation of being the best confiseuse in Northern France, but her
        inborn modesty kept her from accepting any compliment. She broke so
        easily - at least that was what my father would come to say - yet she
        stood the tallest despite the weather. The first eight years of my life
        were relatively soundless. If I were to go back and throw a ball of yarn
        against my bedroom window, I probably would have been able to hear it.
        My parents used to rise together at the faintest hint of dawn and sip
        coffee, Mother with a novel and Father with Le Parisien, occasionally
        locking eyes as if to say, "Mon dieu, je t'aime tellement." I would
        watch this from the thin crack of my bedroom door and inhale their light
        as if to retain it forever, not knowing that it was a fruitless task,
        for soon after my ninth birthday there was no light left, only rough
        blue dark that filled my lungs like fiberglass. My parents’ confiserie
        was among the oldest in Old Paris, inherited as it were from my
        namesake, Grandpère Julian, my father’s father. It was once said that I
        was born in the shop, my mother heaving me out of her amongst the
        almonds and fruits and sugars. It was just the first of many family
        myths that I had learned to entertain and then quickly dismiss: Julian,
        you are part sugar. In any case, I grew up there. If I wasn’t in school
        or at home, I was sitting at one of the few tables that lined the
        windows of the shop, eating raspberry guimauves and reading. My mother
        spent most of her days in the kitchen whipping and whisking and slicing,
        stopping only to deliver trays of fresh sweets to my father, who would
        then arrange them in the cases with admirable precision. She might pause
        briefly to kiss him, or to ensure that I was keeping up with my studies
        (all she had to do was raise a brow if I met her gaze). My father would
        tend to the patrons; that was what he did best. He never seemed to tire
        of boxing up têtes de chocolat and placing sucettes in children’s palms
        and chatting with the regulars over le chocolat chaud. Occasionally he
        would have me help fill larger orders, paying me with another guimauve.
        He would wink at me as if to say, “Don’t tell your mother.” I smiled
        then, because I thought that would be the first and only secret between
        us. It wasn’t. I wish I could go back and erase that smile off my sticky
        face, as if to tell him that I wanted no part of it - any of it: the
        guimauves and his drinking and his women (right now, imagine the sound
        of your most favorite song ending - forever). This leads me to the
        second family myth: Love is always enough. Sometimes I think about what
        would have been different about my life had I kept believing that,
        instead of being a child who realized that his parents manufactured
        false truths right before his too-trusting eyes. The first time I heard
        my mother weep because of my father (right now, imagine the sensation of
        coughing up a knife), I was an inch shy of nine and learning long
        division. Irony tastes no different to me than my mother’s pastilles du
        mineur - hard and black and terrifying. Which brings me to the third
        family myth: Sugar is always sweet. I just sat at my rickety table and
        pressed my pencil so hard into my notebook as if to signal to them that
        my little world had been reduced to making sense of problems that cannot
        be solved. Yet she continued to cry and eventually he would leave, only
        to stumble home at the smallest hour of night smelling of something I
        wouldn’t come to recognize until I was much older: sex and regret and
        more sex. Sometimes I wish I could have leveraged my smallness to my
        advantage. When you are small, you have more power than you know to
        augment your reality. I would have shrunken myself into the tiniest
        common denominator and crept into my mother’s cocons, breathing in their
        musky sweet smell and breathing out my parents’ old light, dead and
        yellow and broken. Or I would have made myself small enough to rest my
        head on her Coussins de Lyon - tiny teal cushions that could have
        carried me into sleep instead of leading me from it (right now, imagine
        the darkest of dark things clawing at you, leaving bloody lines down
        your back). The back door of our kitchen led to a magasin de papier.
        Sometimes, when either their yelling or their silence became too much, I
        would click open the doorknob (right now, imagine the sound your heart
        might make if it woke up after a thousand-year sleep), and Mdme. Laurent
        would say, “Bonjour, Julian!” in a way that my mother never had, and she
        would tousle my hair and show me her newest calligraphy sets. By the
        time I was sixteen, she had stopped pretending that I was a boy, but I
        didn’t. I think about the sweetness of Mdme’s mouth, and how I wish I
        would have captured it in a confection, though I wouldn’t have called it
        "‘Mdme’s Mouth," but rather "Love or Something Like It." I think about
        my parents’ bitter tongues, and how I wish I would have captured it in a
        confection, if only so they could know what it had been like for me as a
        boy; to be deceived and subsequently disappointed, ill. I don’t know
        what I would have called it, though. Sometimes there are no words, just
        feelings. Sometimes I think about my daughter’s smallness and if she
        ever wishes to be a tree. And how I wish she didn’t view me as a tree
        because that is such a thing to live up to: damn near indestructible and
        also so fragile (right now, imagine your mother’s smallest voice and how
        sometimes it sounds like branches cracking, but other times it sounds
        like nothing). Everything assumes such a small quality when you are
        approaching death. You are a tree amongst the seeds - waiting, waiting,
        waiting - for the soil and the sun to dry you up, to release you from
        the feeling of immensity. And in that smallness rests another seed, one
        of calm or something like it - an abundance of agency and hope. ----
        seedling ---- The light bulb flickered, humming to a dim glow in the
        sitting room of Symon Shevchenko’s farmhouse. He had refused to leave.
        He had lived in that house his entire life, born there, his father born
        there; he was too old, he told the mayor, to pick up and come to town
        with everyone else. What would he do there? He is farmer. He does not
        know how to live in a small apartment, surrounded by concrete. If the
        darkness decided to envelope him, so be it. He picked up a tattered copy
        of Gogol’s Dead Souls, put on his reading glasses, and settled into his
        favorite chair to read. And wait. For three weeks, the darkness had been
        encroaching upon the village. No one noticed at first as it swallowed
        the deeper forest, taking with it the elk, the deer, the wild boar, the
        hare. Then it obliterated the stream that fed their wells, along with
        the perch and the sturgeon. When the farms on the furthest outskirts
        disappeared, along with their livestock, their families, then the people
        started to notice, and talk. “Have you been out to the Abramov farm?” A
        middle-aged woman clutched her handbag and held her jacket closed at the
        collar. “There is nothing there. Just dark fog.” She looked over her
        shoulder as if the darkness was listening. “Why would I go out there?
        Oksana, leave the outskirts to the soldiers. There is nothing we can
        do.” Alyona shook her head and made the sign of the cross. A truck
        rumbled by loaded with cables, towing floodlights and a generator. The
        driver acknowledged the women as he sped past, the engine grinding into
        high gear. “More lights,” Alyona commented as she watched the work truck
        lurch toward the farm lands. “With God’s blessings, may it work.” The
        electrician had volunteered for this. He knew how to lay cable, to make
        sure the circuits could distribute the load without tripping a breaker.
        Soldiers had been deployed to implement the emergency plan, but lighting
        up the entire border was a monumental effort that taxed the military’s
        resources. Every able-bodied person was asked to help, implored to help,
        and electricians were hailed as heroes for their knowledge. They arrived
        at Symon Shevchenko’s farm in the middle of the afternoon; they had
        ample time to place the generators and lay cable before the sun would
        relinquish its place and allow the darkness to seep in from the north.
        Maxim jumped off the truck and scanned the fields, the farmer’s young
        crops, the neighbor’s house in the distance, and the black, impenetrable
        fog that hovered behind a grove of trees, waiting for its opportunity to
        expand. To the west he could see the generators and floodlights his team
        had placed yesterday. The empty nothingness silently churning outside of
        their reach dwarfed the lights and stretched the limits of his ability
        to hope. He shook off his gloomy thoughts and got to work. One more farm
        to save, or at least stave off the disappearing long enough for someone
        to figure it out. Andriy was already staking out where the equipment
        would go. Maxim hustled to give him a hand. “What are you thinking—fifty
        meters from the darkness?” Maxim eyeballed the distance to the dark edge
        of the opaque black fog. Andriy looked over his shoulder, toward the
        floodlights placed yesterday. “It seemed to work over there,” he glanced
        up at Maxim as he nodded toward the last farm. “I can still see the
        Melnyk farm.” He dug into the soil, and placed a bright orange marker.
        Symon looked up from his book and watched the crews setting up the
        enormous lights. He was interrupted by a knock at the door. “Sir, we’re
        setting up the generator a little ways off the back of your house,” the
        young soldier was in full combat gear, covered in a fine layer of
        Symon’s topsoil. “You’ll need to listen for it throughout the night. If
        it stops running, if you have any concerns, light a flare—” he held one
        up to make the point, then offered Symon a bag of six. “Are you sure you
        wouldn’t like to come to town? It’s safer there.” Symon smiled at the
        soldier, that smile old people make when they don’t want to hear good
        advice from a young person. How old is he, 19, maybe 20? Not much older
        than my grandson. “Thank you, I’ll be fine here.” He patted the young
        man on the forearm and accepted the bag of flares. “Okay, well, we have
        guards watching all night. If you have any concerns, just light a flare
        and we’ll come.” Symon nodded and shut the door. The sun was beginning
        its final descent, perfectly framed in the lower half of one casement
        window. Symon considered it, how beautiful the sunset is, then headed to
        the kitchen to make dinner. The generator roared to life. The lights
        overwhelmed the dying day and glared in at him. The generator was the
        only sound now. With the darkness came silence, because nothing lived in
        that black fog. At least, nothing living had ever come out of it, and
        the darkness had never retreated to reveal what it might leave behind.
        Symon had heard scientists were monitoring it, and there were reports of
        kids who dared each other to touch it, enter it. I think that’s how
        Krystiyan’s grandkid disappeared. He put a frozen dinner in the
        microwave. The last red-orange hues of the day rested on the horizon as
        deep purples streaked the sky from the east, but Symon’s house was lit
        from the outside by the harsh manufactured glow. He took a few bites of
        dinner but he wasn’t really hungry. He put down his fork, and looked out
        the kitchen window: what’s in there? What does it feel like, that black
        fog? He understood the curiosity of the children, at the same time he
        knew that the question could be answered definitively only once. The
        generator hummed in the background. He got up from the table, leaving
        his plate where it sat, and walked to the back door. The old brass
        doorknob felt cold in his hand. He opened it, surprised at how loud the
        squeak from the hinges sounded when there were no crickets, no wolves,
        no owls singing their evening ballads. Symon stepped outside into the
        cool air. Darkness on the farm was not unusual, but this darkness
        obliterated even the outlines of trees. There was nothing beyond the
        black fog, nothing above it, certainly nothing hinted at its base. It
        was as if some force had built a massive wall, a curtain, to hide what
        had always been there, or to take it for itself. And each day it stole a
        little bit more. He walked across the yard, past his barn, the engine of
        the generator louder with each step. But it was not a welcome respite
        from the silence. On the contrary, it seemed to amplify it. There was no
        other noise. He thrust his hands in his pockets as he walked, checking
        on his cows and goats who calmly chewed their roughage, oblivious to the
        danger. For a brief moment, life felt normal. He left the animals’ pens
        and strode the few feet to the edge of the manmade illumination. Symon
        was dwarfed by the poles holding the 400-watt lamps, and the lamps were
        dwarfed by the roiling black wall of fog they held back. He looked up;
        the fog billowed out and disappeared as it hit the light. He looked left
        and right; as far as he could see, the darkness tested the light’s edge,
        and disappeared as it hit the artificial glow. Symon walked as closely
        as he could, peering into it, trying to see something beyond the
        billowing surface. Like the rebel pre-teens scolded by the soldiers, he
        reached his hand toward the darkness, slowly. He twisted his hand as he
        watched it fade from sight, first his fingers, then the back of his
        thumb, then his wrist. It felt like nothing, vaguely cold, but neither
        comforting nor painful. He pulled his hand back, and studied it,
        stretching his fingers, making a fist. Hm, my joints seem to ache less,
        and he looked at his other hand, performing the same maneuvers. His
        fingers stiff with the dull pains of age and use reminded him of the
        years of hard labor coaxing food from the soil. I wonder. . . he
        extended his second hand into the black fog bank, and watched it
        disappear like the first. He withdrew it, and flexed his fingers. No
        pain. “Huh,” he inspected his hands as if they belonged to some other
        creature, then looked up at the darkness. He stood there for a moment,
        contemplating the pros and cons of testing the fog further. If he
        entered, could he could come back out? Would the stiffness of age, the
        old injuries of youth, be gone? Symon walked within the protection of
        the light along the edge of the black fog and ran his fingers through
        it, the way a dog sticks its nose out of the truck’s window, enjoying
        the breeze. He walked a kilometer or more, to the edge of the Malnyk
        farm, when he noticed a spot of brightness in the haze. The darkness had
        obscured part of Malnyk’s fields, specifically where he grew sunflowers.
        The plants were tiny shoots planted just recently, no more than squat
        stems with two embryonic cotyledon leaves. Some of the plants had been
        trampled by the earnest work crews placing lights. Those that survived
        under the lights were spindly, likes plants grown in a lit greenhouse.
        But at the foot of the darkness, where nothing was alive, not even
        grasses, Symon Shevchenko could see a faint green luminescence. “What is
        this?” he muttered under his breath as he knelt down to inspect the
        shock of color. Along the dense, misty edge of the darkness, small
        seedlings radiated a faint green glow, like phosphorescent mushrooms or
        bugs. The seedlings had each carved a small clearing in the fog, like
        little lanterns of their own making, lighting the radius of their
        leaves. Symon looked along the length of the planted row. He could see
        little circles of green light reaching into the depths of the darkness,
        each less intense than the one in front of it, little beacons marching
        against the gloom. Symon reached down and gently touched the leaves of
        the seedling just inside the edge of the fog. It felt strong and
        vibrant. The embryonic leaves were thick, dark green, with tiny white
        hairs like an old man’s unshaven face, or the crown of a newborn babe.
        But nothing else grew. No animals or insects dared to nibble on the
        fresh shoots that fought against the darkness. No weeds crowded them.
        Symon stood and pondered his discovery—why hasn’t someone noticed this?
        He rose and dusted the dirt from his hands and walked back home. His
        footsteps on the soil kept a beat for the generators’ constant hum.
        Symon glanced across his land that still lay untouched by the darkness.
        The work crew was out with the morning sun measuring new encroachments
        made by the darkness overnight. Symon completed his morning chores, fed
        his animals, checked his fields. He decided to go check on Malnyk’s
        sunflowers again. The sky to the south was bright blue. The sounds of
        tractors, chickens, sheep and goats replaced the hum of generators. To
        the north, the darkness was as impenetrable as the day before. Symon
        walked along its edge, greeting the soldiers and volunteers who were out
        checking and double-checking the cables, generators and lamps. As he
        approached Malnyk’s farm, he slowed and surveyed the field. Sunflowers
        are hardy plants, and in spite of the extra foot traffic, the crop
        seemed to have recovered. He stopped at one row, and ran his eyes along
        its length, from where it began perpendicular to the dirt road, to where
        it disappeared into the darkness. He turned and followed it, right up to
        the churning blackness. He scanned the wall of billowing black fog; it
        didn’t look any different now than it did during the night. He turned
        and squinted at the sun, grateful to have its protection. Just like the
        night before, he bent down and looked at the seedlings. It was much more
        obvious, when the only darkness was the unnatural evil descending from
        the north, that the tiny sunflower seedling had carved a small space
        free from the taint. It was hard to verify, but it seemed to Symon that
        the sunflower seedlings continued to break the darkness as the row
        disappeared into the fog. A soldier came by with a wheelbarrow full of
        electrical gear. “Do you need some help, old-timer?” “No, no, just
        checking my neighbor’s crops,” Symon shook his head and smiled at the
        young man. Then he headed home. He had an idea, and needed help. He
        waved to the crew checking his generator as he strode past. He grabbed
        the keys for his old truck and headed to town. He needed to tell his
        friends and the other farmers what he found. He pulled up to a diner and
        parked next to Mykola’s truck. A number of old farmers, men and women,
        sat at a table discussing the developments of the night. They waved
        Symon over when he entered. He signaled the waitress for a cup of
        coffee, and told them what he had seen. “You’re saying the sunflower
        seedlings beat back the darkness?” Zlata knit her brow. She had seen the
        black fog destroy half her farm, and take her dog too. “Do you think
        anything else is alive in there?” “All I could see were the seedlings,”
        Symon replied. “There were not even weeds growing with them, no bugs on
        the leaves.” “And it felt like . . .nothing?” Dmytro leaned in, and
        pushed back the brim of his cap. The table of farmers was joined by
        others, people who formed the foundation of the town, grandmothers and
        grandfathers, great aunts and great uncles. They stayed well past noon,
        the meals changed from breakfast to lunch, a few happily claiming they
        had earned their early beers after staying up with the generators the
        night before. “So it’s settled,” Symon smiled at his table of friends,
        and every face smiled back, nodding in agreement. Late afternoon, the
        young soldier knocked on Symon’s door. “Hello, sir. I just wanted to
        make sure you have those flares I gave you yesterday.” Symon smiled and
        nodded. “Are you sure we can’t take you to town?” “No, no, I will be
        alright. This is my home! I am not afraid of the darkness.” The young
        soldier nodded deferentially and walked back to his truck. The sunset
        was particularly beautiful, framed in the sitting room window, every
        shade of crimson below, the radiant deep blue of evening settling in
        from above. The generators hummed to life. Symon put down his book, took
        off his reading glasses, and headed for the door. At the barn, he picked
        up a large burlap sack full of sunflower seeds and hooked the strap over
        his shoulder. He walked to the back of his property, where the dark fog
        toiled and curled, raging against the wall of light. He was joined by
        another farmer, and then another, until everyone who was at the diner,
        plus others who had heard the story, stood at the edge of the light, at
        the edge of the darkness, each with their own sacks of seeds hung from
        their shoulders. They spread out, laughing and talking as they each took
        up a spot along the edge of the fog. “For our town,” shouted one man.
        “For our children,” shouted another. “For our children’s children,”
        echoed across the fields. They turned and smiled at each other, grabbing
        handfuls of seed. “Glory be forever!” They walked into the fog, sowing
        sunflower seeds as far as their arms could fling them. The grim soldiers
        continued their work fighting off the darkness. The young man had
        knocked at Symon Shevchenko’s door, but did not receive an answer. He
        tipped his head, his helmet hiding his face, and returned to the
        generator. Maxim was preparing to lay cable at another farm when he
        realized he was too far away. “Andriy, did you check distance? We’re too
        far.” The light standards placed yesterday were more than fifty meters
        from the black fog. Maxim eyed the churning blackness, and looked down
        the long line of lights placed over the previous weeks. All of them were
        too far. Confusion on his face, he decided to walk off the distance,
        taking meter-long strides toward the darkness. He confirmed the
        fifty-meter mark was no longer near the edge. In its place was a field
        of tiny sunflower shoots, strong and healthy, no weeds, no insects. He
        walked a few meters into the seedlings up to the edge of the darkness,
        and saw that small patches of green light continued into the diminishing
        black fog. Within a month, the darkness had been pushed back and
        reduced, replaced by an endless sea of sunflower stalks, their green
        flowerheads watching the sun. By the end of summer, they towered above
        the town folks’ heads, filling in the space beneath the trees with their
        bright yellow faces, and the darkness surrendered its last hold. ----
        what you want --- Night had fallen on that great and beautiful city
        known as Bagdad-on-the-Subway. And with the night came the enchanted
        glamour that belongs not to Arabia alone. In different masquerade the
        streets, bazaars and walled houses of the occidental city of romance
        were filled with the same kind of folk that so much interested our
        interesting old friend, the late Mr. H. A. Rashid. They wore clothes
        eleven hundred years nearer to the latest styles than H. A. saw in old
        Bagdad; but they were about the same people underneath. With the eye of
        faith, you could have seen the Little Hunchback, Sinbad the Sailor,
        Fitbad the Tailor, the Beautiful Persian, the one-eyed Calenders, Ali
        Baba and Forty Robbers on every block, and the Barber and his Six
        Brothers, and all the old Arabian gang easily. But let us revenue to our
        lamb chops. Old Tom Crowley was a caliph. He had $42,000,000 in
        preferred stocks and bonds with solid gold edges. In these times, to be
        called a caliph you must have money. The old-style caliph business as
        conducted by Mr. Rashid is not safe. If you hold up a person nowadays in
        a bazaar or a Turkish bath or a side street, and inquire into his
        private and personal affairs, the police court'll get you. Old Tom was
        tired of clubs, theatres, dinners, friends, music, money and everything.
        That's what makes a caliph--you must get to despise everything that
        money can buy, and then go out and try to want something that you can't
        pay for. "I'll take a little trot around town all by myself," thought
        old Tom, "and try if I can stir up anything new. Let's see--it seems
        I've read about a king or a Cardiff giant or something in old times who
        used to go about with false whiskers on, making Persian dates with folks
        he hadn't been introduced to. That don't listen like a bad idea. I
        certainly have got a case of humdrumness and fatigue on for the ones I
        do know. That old Cardiff used to pick up cases of trouble as he ran
        upon 'em and give 'em gold--sequins, I think it was--and make 'em marry
        or got 'em good Government jobs. Now, I'd like something of that sort.
        My money is as good as his was even if the magazines do ask me every
        month where I got it. Yes, I guess I'll do a little Cardiff business
        to-night, and see how it goes." Plainly dressed, old Tom Crowley left
        his Madison Avenue palace, and walked westward and then south. As he
        stepped to the sidewalk, Fate, who holds the ends of the strings in the
        central offices of all the enchanted cities pulled a thread, and a young
        man twenty blocks away looked at a wall clock, and then put on his coat.
        James Turner worked in one of those little hat-cleaning establishments
        on Sixth Avenue in which a fire alarm rings when you push the door open,
        and where they clean your hat while you wait--two days. James stood all
        day at an electric machine that turned hats around faster than the best
        brands of champagne ever could have done. Overlooking your mild
        impertinence in feeling a curiosity about the personal appearance of a
        stranger, I will give you a modified description of him. Weight, 118;
        complexion, hair and brain, light; height, five feet six; age, about
        twenty-three; dressed in a $10 suit of greenish-blue serge; pockets
        containing two keys and sixty-three cents in change. But do not
        misconjecture because this description sounds like a General Alarm that
        James was either lost or a dead one. _Allons!_ James stood all day at
        his work. His feet were tender and extremely susceptible to impositions
        being put upon or below them. All day long they burned and smarted,
        causing him much suffering and inconvenience. But he was earning twelve
        dollars per week, which he needed to support his feet whether his feet
        would support him or not. James Turner had his own conception of what
        happiness was, just as you and I have ours. Your delight is to gad about
        the world in yachts and motor-cars and to hurl ducats at wild fowl. Mine
        is to smoke a pipe at evenfall and watch a badger, a rattlesnake, and an
        owl go into their common prairie home one by one. James Turner's idea of
        bliss was different; but it was his. He would go directly to his
        boarding-house when his day's work was done. After his supper of small
        steak, Bessemer potatoes, stooed (not stewed) apples and infusion of
        chicory, he would ascend to his fifth-floor-back hall room. Then he
        would take off his shoes and socks, place the soles of his burning feet
        against the cold bars of his iron bed, and read Clark Russell's sea
        yarns. The delicious relief of the cool metal applied to his smarting
        soles was his nightly joy. His favorite novels never palled upon him;
        the sea and the adventures of its navigators were his sole intellectual
        passion. No millionaire was ever happier than James Turner taking his
        ease. When James left the hat-cleaning shop he walked three blocks out
        of his way home to look over the goods of a second-hand bookstall. On
        the sidewalk stands he had more than once picked up a paper-covered
        volume of Clark Russell at half price. While he was bending with a
        scholarly stoop over the marked-down miscellany of cast-off literature,
        old Tom the caliph sauntered by. His discerning eye, made keen by twenty
        years' experience in the manufacture of laundry soap (save the
        wrappers!) recognized instantly the poor and discerning scholar, a
        worthy object of his caliphanous mood. He descended the two shallow
        stone steps that led from the sidewalk, and addressed without hesitation
        the object of his designed munificence. His first words were no worse
        than salutatory and tentative. James Turner looked up coldly, with
        "Sartor Resartus" in one hand and "A Mad Marriage" in the other. "Beat
        it," said he. "I don't want to buy any coat hangers or town lots in
        Hankipoo, New Jersey. Run along, now, and play with your Teddy bear."
        "Young man," said the caliph, ignoring the flippancy of the hat cleaner,
        "I observe that you are of a studious disposition. Learning is one of
        the finest things in the world. I never had any of it worth mentioning,
        but I admire to see it in others. I come from the West, where we imagine
        nothing but facts. Maybe I couldn't understand the poetry and allusions
        in them books you are picking over, but I like to see somebody else seem
        to know what they mean. I'm worth about $40,000,000, and I'm getting
        richer every day. I made the height of it manufacturing Aunt Patty's
        Silver Soap. I invented the art of making it. I experimented for three
        years before I got just the right quantity of chloride of sodium
        solution and caustic potash mixture to curdle properly. And after I had
        taken some $9,000,000 out of the soap business I made the rest in corn
        and wheat futures. Now, you seem to have the literary and scholarly turn
        of character; and I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll pay for your
        education at the finest college in the world. I'll pay the expense of
        your rummaging over Europe and the art galleries, and finally set you up
        in a good business. You needn't make it soap if you have any objections.
        I see by your clothes and frazzled necktie that you are mighty poor; and
        you can't afford to turn down the offer. Well, when do you want to
        begin?" The hat cleaner turned upon old Tom the eye of the Big City,
        which is an eye expressive of cold and justifiable suspicion, of
        judgment suspended as high as Haman was hung, of self-preservation, of
        challenge, curiosity, defiance, cynicism, and, strange as you may think
        it, of a childlike yearning for friendliness and fellowship that must be
        hidden when one walks among the "stranger bands." For in New Bagdad one,
        in order to survive, must suspect whosoever sits, dwells, drinks, rides,
        walks or sleeps in the adjacent chair, house, booth, seat, path or room.
        "Say, Mike," said James Turner, "what's your line, anyway--shoe laces?
        I'm not buying anything. You better put an egg in your shoe and beat it
        before incidents occur to you. You can't work off any fountain pens,
        gold spectacles you found on the street, or trust company certificate
        house clearings on me. Say, do I look like I'd climbed down one of them
        missing fire-escapes at Helicon Hall? What's vitiating you, anyhow?"
        "Son," said the caliph, in his most Harunish tones, "as I said, I'm
        worth $40,000,000. I don't want to have it all put in my coffin when I
        die. I want to do some good with it. I seen you handling over these here
        volumes of literature, and I thought I'd keep you. I've give the
        missionary societies $2,000,000, but what did I get out of it? Nothing
        but a receipt from the secretary. Now, you are just the kind of young
        man I'd like to take up and see what money could make of him." Volumes
        of Clark Russell were hard to find that evening at the Old Book Shop.
        And James Turner's smarting and aching feet did not tend to improve his
        temper. Humble hat cleaner though he was, he had a spirit equal to any
        caliph's. "Say, you old faker," he said, angrily, "be on your way. I
        don't know what your game is, unless you want change for a bogus
        $40,000,000 bill. Well, I don't carry that much around with me. But I do
        carry a pretty fair left-handed punch that you'll get if you don't move
        on." "You are a blamed impudent little gutter pup," said the caliph.
        Then James delivered his self-praised punch; old Tom seized him by the
        collar and kicked him thrice; the hat cleaner rallied and clinched; two
        bookstands were overturned, and the books sent flying. A copy came up,
        took an arm of each, and marched them to the nearest station house.
        "Fighting and disorderly conduct," said the cop to the sergeant. "Three
        hundred dollars bail," said the sergeant at once, asseveratingly and
        inquiringly. "Sixty-three cents," said James Turner with a harsh laugh.
        The caliph searched his pockets and collected small bills and change
        amounting to four dollars. "I am worth," he said, "forty million
        dollars, but--" "Lock 'em up," ordered the sergeant. In his cell, James
        Turner laid himself on his cot, ruminating. "Maybe he's got the money,
        and maybe he ain't. But if he has or he ain't, what does he want to go
        'round butting into other folks's business for? When a man knows what he
        wants, and can get it, it's the same as $40,000,000 to him." Then an
        idea came to him that brought a pleased look to his face. He removed his
        socks, drew his cot close to the door, stretched himself out
        luxuriously, and placed his tortured feet against the cold bars of the
        cell door. Something hard and bulky under the blankets of his cot gave
        one shoulder discomfort. He reached under, and drew out a paper-covered
        volume by Clark Russell called "A Sailor's Sweetheart." He gave a great
        sigh of contentment. Presently, to his cell came the doorman and said:
        "Say, kid, that old gazabo that was pinched with you for scrapping seems
        to have been the goods after all. He 'phoned to his friends, and he's
        out at the desk now with a roll of yellowbacks as big as a Pullman car
        pillow. He wants to bail you, and for you to come out and see him."
        "Tell him I ain't in," said James Turner. ---- a chameleon ---- THE
        police superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square
        wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. A red-haired
        policeman strides after him with a sieve full of confiscated
        gooseberries in his hands. There is silence all around. Not a soul in
        the square. . . . The open doors of the shops and taverns look out upon
        God's world disconsolately, like hungry mouths; there is not even a
        beggar near them. "So you bite, you damned brute?" Otchumyelov hears
        suddenly. "Lads, don't let him go! Biting is prohibited nowadays! Hold
        him! ah . . . ah!" There is the sound of a dog yelping. Otchumyelov
        looks in the direction of the sound and sees a dog, hopping on three
        legs and looking about her, run out of Pitchugin's timber-yard. A man in
        a starched cotton shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing her.
        He runs after her, and throwing his body forward falls down and seizes
        the dog by her hind legs. Once more there is a yelping and a shout of
        "Don't let go!" Sleepy countenances are protruded from the shops, and
        soon a crowd, which seems to have sprung out of the earth, is gathered
        round the timber-yard. "It looks like a row, your honour . . ." says the
        policeman. Otchumyelov makes a half turn to the left and strides towards
        the crowd. He sees the aforementioned man in the unbuttoned waistcoat
        standing close by the gate of the timber-yard, holding his right hand in
        the air and displaying a bleeding finger to the crowd. On his
        half-drunken face there is plainly written: "I'll pay you out, you
        rogue!" and indeed the very finger has the look of a flag of victory. In
        this man Otchumyelov recognises Hryukin, the goldsmith. The culprit who
        has caused the sensation, a white borzoy puppy with a sharp muzzle and a
        yellow patch on her back, is sitting on the ground with her fore-paws
        outstretched in the middle of the crowd, trembling all over. There is an
        expression of misery and terror in her tearful eyes. "What's it all
        about?" Otchumyelov inquires, pushing his way through the crowd. "What
        are you here for? Why are you waving your finger . . . ? Who was it
        shouted?" "I was walking along here, not interfering with anyone, your
        honour," Hryukin begins, coughing into his fist. "I was talking about
        firewood to Mitry Mitritch, when this low brute for no rhyme or reason
        bit my finger. . . . You must excuse me, I am a working man. . . . Mine
        is fine work. I must have damages, for I shan't be able to use this
        finger for a week, may be. . . . It's not even the law, your honour,
        that one should put up with it from a beast. . . . If everyone is going
        to be bitten, life won't be worth living. . . ." "H'm. Very good," says
        Otchumyelov sternly, coughing and raising his eyebrows. "Very good.
        Whose dog is it? I won't let this pass! I'll teach them to let their
        dogs run all over the place! It's time these gentry were looked after,
        if they won't obey the regulations! When he's fined, the blackguard,
        I'll teach him what it means to keep dogs and such stray cattle! I'll
        give him a lesson! . . . Yeldyrin," cries the superintendent, addressing
        the policeman, "find out whose dog this is and draw up a report! And the
        dog must be strangled. Without delay! It's sure to be mad. . . . Whose
        dog is it, I ask?" "I fancy it's General Zhigalov's," says someone in
        the crowd. "General Zhigalov's, h'm. . . . Help me off with my coat,
        Yeldyrin . . . it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain. . . .
        There's one thing I can't make out, how it came to bite you?"
        Otchumyelov turns to Hryukin. "Surely it couldn't reach your finger.
        It's a little dog, and you are a great hulking fellow! You must have
        scratched your finger with a nail, and then the idea struck you to get
        damages for it. We all know . . . your sort! I know you devils!" "He put
        a cigarette in her face, your honour, for a joke, and she had the sense
        to snap at him. . . . He is a nonsensical fellow, your honour!" "That's
        a lie, Squinteye! You didn't see, so why tell lies about it? His honour
        is a wise gentleman, and will see who is telling lies and who is telling
        the truth, as in God's sight. . . . And if I am lying let the court
        decide. It's written in the law. . . . We are all equal nowadays. My own
        brother is in the gendarmes . . . let me tell you. . . ." "Don't argue!"
        "No, that's not the General's dog," says the policeman, with profound
        conviction, "the General hasn't got one like that. His are mostly
        setters." "Do you know that for a fact?" "Yes, your honour." "I know it,
        too. The General has valuable dogs, thoroughbred, and this is goodness
        knows what! No coat, no shape. . . . A low creature. And to keep a dog
        like that! . . . where's the sense of it. If a dog like that were to
        turn up in Petersburg or Moscow, do you know what would happen? They
        would not worry about the law, they would strangle it in a twinkling!
        You've been injured, Hryukin, and we can't let the matter drop. . . . We
        must give them a lesson! It is high time . . . . !" "Yet maybe it is the
        General's," says the policeman, thinking aloud. "It's not written on its
        face. . . . I saw one like it the other day in his yard." "It is the
        General's, that's certain! " says a voice in the crowd. "H'm, help me on
        with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I
        am cold. . . . You take it to the General's, and inquire there. Say I
        found it and sent it. And tell them not to let it out into the street. .
        . . It may be a valuable dog, and if every swine goes sticking a cigar
        in its mouth, it will soon be ruined. A dog is a delicate animal. . . .
        And you put your hand down, you blockhead. It's no use your displaying
        your fool of a finger. It's your own fault. . . ." "Here comes the
        General's cook, ask him. . . Hi, Prohor! Come here, my dear man! Look at
        this dog. . . . Is it one of yours?" "What an idea! We have never had
        one like that!" "There's no need to waste time asking," says
        Otchumyelov. "It's a stray dog! There's no need to waste time talking
        about it. . . . Since he says it's a stray dog, a stray dog it is. . . .
        It must be destroyed, that's all about it." "It is not our dog," Prohor
        goes on. "It belongs to the General's brother, who arrived the other
        day. Our master does not care for hounds. But his honour is fond of
        them. . . ." "You don't say his Excellency's brother is here? Vladimir
        Ivanitch?" inquires Otchumyelov, and his whole face beams with an
        ecstatic smile. "'Well, I never! And I didn't know! Has he come on a
        visit? "Yes." "Well, I never. . . . He couldn't stay away from his
        brother. . . . And there I didn't know! So this is his honour's dog?
        Delighted to hear it. . . . Take it. It's not a bad pup. . . . A lively
        creature. . . . Snapped at this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha. . . . Come,
        why are you shivering? Rrr . . . Rrrr. . . . The rogue's angry . . . a
        nice little pup." Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the
        timber-yard with her. The crowd laughs at Hryukin. "I'll make you smart
        yet!" Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping himself in his greatcoat,
        goes on his way across the square. ---- the vendetta ---- The widow of
        Paolo Saverini lived alone with her son in a poor little house on the
        outskirts of Bonifacio. The town, built on an outjutting part of the
        mountain, in places even overhanging the sea, looks across the straits,
        full of sandbanks, towards the southernmost coast of Sardinia. Beneath
        it, on the other side and almost surrounding it, is a cleft in the cliff
        like an immense corridor which serves as a harbor, and along it the
        little Italian and Sardinian fishing boats come by a circuitous route
        between precipitous cliffs as far as the first houses, and every two
        weeks the old, wheezy steamer which makes the trip to Ajaccio. On the
        white mountain the houses, massed together, makes an even whiter spot.
        They look like the nests of wild birds, clinging to this peak,
        overlooking this terrible passage, where vessels rarely venture. The
        wind, which blows uninterruptedly, has swept bare the forbidding coast;
        it drives through the narrow straits and lays waste both sides. The pale
        streaks of foam, clinging to the black rocks, whose countless peaks rise
        up out of the water, look like bits of rag floating and drifting on the
        surface of the sea. The house of widow Saverini, clinging to the very
        edge of the precipice, looks out, through its three windows, over this
        wild and desolate picture. She lived there alone, with her son Antonia
        and their dog "Semillante," a big, thin beast, with a long rough coat,
        of the sheep-dog breed. The young man took her with him when out
        hunting. One night, after some kind of a quarrel, Antoine Saverini was
        treacherously stabbed by Nicolas Ravolati, who escaped the same evening
        to Sardinia. When the old mother received the body of her child, which
        the neighbors had brought back to her, she did not cry, but she stayed
        there for a long time motionless, watching him. Then, stretching her
        wrinkled hand over the body, she promised him a vendetta. She did not
        wish anybody near her, and she shut herself up beside the body with the
        dog, which howled continuously, standing at the foot of the bed, her
        head stretched towards her master and her tail between her legs. She did
        not move any more than did the mother, who, now leaning over the body
        with a blank stare, was weeping silently and watching it. The young man,
        lying on his back, dressed in his jacket of coarse cloth, torn at the
        chest, seemed to be asleep. But he had blood all over him; on his shirt,
        which had been torn off in order to administer the first aid; on his
        vest, on his trousers, on his face, on his hands. Clots of blood had
        hardened in his beard and in his hair. His old mother began to talk to
        him. At the sound of this voice the dog quieted down. "Never fear, my
        boy, my little baby, you shall be avenged. Sleep, sleep; you shall be
        avenged. Do you hear? It's your mother's promise! And she always keeps
        her word, your mother does, you know she does." Slowly she leaned over
        him, pressing her cold lips to his dead ones. Then Semillante began to
        howl again with a long, monotonous, penetrating, horrible howl. The two
        of them, the woman and the dog, remained there until morning. Antoine
        Saverini was buried the next day and soon his name ceased to be
        mentioned in Bonifacio. He had neither brothers nor cousins. No man was
        there to carry on the vendetta. His mother, the old woman, alone
        pondered over it. On the other side of the straits she saw, from morning
        until night, a little white speck on the coast. It was the little
        Sardinian village Longosardo, where Corsican criminals take refuge when
        they are too closely pursued. They compose almost the entire population
        of this hamlet, opposite their native island, awaiting the time to
        return, to go back to the "maquis." She knew that Nicolas Ravolati had
        sought refuge in this village. All alone, all day long, seated at her
        window, she was looking over there and thinking of revenge. How could
        she do anything without help--she, an invalid and so near death? But she
        had promised, she had sworn on the body. She could not forget, she could
        not wait. What could she do? She no longer slept at night; she had
        neither rest nor peace of mind; she thought persistently. The dog,
        dozing at her feet, would sometimes lift her head and howl. Since her
        master's death she often howled thus, as though she were calling him, as
        though her beast's soul, inconsolable too, had also retained a
        recollection that nothing could wipe out. One night, as Semillante began
        to howl, the mother suddenly got hold of an idea, a savage, vindictive,
        fierce idea. She thought it over until morning. Then, having arisen at
        daybreak she went to church. She prayed, prostrate on the floor, begging
        the Lord to help her, to support her, to give to her poor, broken-down
        body the strength which she needed in order to avenge her son. She
        returned home. In her yard she had an old barrel, which acted as a
        cistern. She turned it over, emptied it, made it fast to the ground with
        sticks and stones. Then she chained Semillante to this improvised kennel
        and went into the house. She walked ceaselessly now, her eyes always
        fixed on the distant coast of Sardinia. He was over there, the murderer.
        All day and all night the dog howled. In the morning the old woman
        brought her some water in a bowl, but nothing more; no soup, no bread.
        Another day went by. Semillante, exhausted, was sleeping. The following
        day her eyes were shining, her hair on end and she was pulling wildly at
        her chain. All this day the old woman gave her nothing to eat. The
        beast, furious, was barking hoarsely. Another night went by. Then, at
        daybreak, Mother Saverini asked a neighbor for some straw. She took the
        old rags which had formerly been worn by her husband and stuffed them so
        as to make them look like a human body. Having planted a stick in the
        ground, in front of Semillante's kennel, she tied to it this dummy,
        which seemed to be standing up. Then she made a head out of some old
        rags. The dog, surprised, was watching this straw man, and was quiet,
        although famished. Then the old woman went to the store and bought a
        piece of black sausage. When she got home she started a fire in the
        yard, near the kennel, and cooked the sausage. Semillante, frantic, was
        jumping about, frothing at the mouth, her eyes fixed on the food, the
        odor of which went right to her stomach. Then the mother made of the
        smoking sausage a necktie for the dummy. She tied it very tight around
        the neck with string, and when she had finished she untied the dog. With
        one leap the beast jumped at the dummy's throat, and with her paws on
        its shoulders she began to tear at it. She would fall back with a piece
        of food in her mouth, then would jump again, sinking her fangs into the
        string, and snatching few pieces of meat she would fall back again and
        once more spring forward. She was tearing up the face with her teeth and
        the whole neck was in tatters. The old woman, motionless and silent, was
        watching eagerly. Then she chained the beast up again, made her fast for
        two more days and began this strange performance again. For three months
        she accustomed her to this battle, to this meal conquered by a fight.
        She no longer chained her up, but just pointed to the dummy. She had
        taught her to tear him up and to devour him without even leaving any
        traces in her throat. Then, as a reward, she would give her a piece of
        sausage. As soon as she saw the man, Semillante would begin to tremble.
        Then she would look up to her mistress, who, lifting her finger, would
        cry, "Go!" in a shrill tone. When she thought that the proper time had
        come, the widow went to confession and, one Sunday morning she partook
        of communion with an ecstatic fervor. Then, putting on men's clothes and
        looking like an old tramp, she struck a bargain with a Sardinian
        fisherman who carried her and her dog to the other side of the straits.
        In a bag she had a large piece of sausage. Semillante had had nothing to
        eat for two days. The old woman kept letting her smell the food and
        whetting her appetite. They got to Longosardo. The Corsican woman walked
        with a limp. She went to a baker's shop and asked for Nicolas Ravolati.
        He had taken up his old trade, that of carpenter. He was working alone
        at the back of his store. The old woman opened the door and called:
        "Hallo, Nicolas!" He turned around. Then releasing her dog, she cried:
        "Go, go! Eat him up! eat him up!" The maddened animal sprang for his
        throat. The man stretched out his arms, clasped the dog and rolled to
        the ground. For a few seconds he squirmed, beating the ground with his
        feet. Then he stopped moving, while Semillante dug her fangs into his
        throat and tore it to ribbons. Two neighbors, seated before their door,
        remembered perfectly having seen an old beggar come out with a thin,
        black dog which was eating something that its master was giving him. At
        nightfall the old woman was at home again. She slept well that night.
        ---- eveline ---- SHE sat at the window watching the evening invade the
        avenue. Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her
        nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired. Few people
        passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way home; she heard
        his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards
        crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time there
        used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with
        other people's children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and
        built houses in it -- not like their little brown houses but bright
        brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play
        together in that field -- the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little
        Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however,
        never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in
        out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh
        used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they
        seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then;
        and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her
        brothers and sisters were all grown up her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn
        was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything
        changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her
        home. Home! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar
        objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering
        where on earth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again
        those familiar objects from which she had never dreamed of being
        divided. And yet during all those years she had never found out the name
        of the priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the
        broken harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to
        Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her
        father. Whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used
        to pass it with a casual word: "He is in Melbourne now." She had
        consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She tried to
        weigh each side of the question. In her home anyway she had shelter and
        food; she had those whom she had known all her life about her. O course
        she had to work hard, both in the house and at business. What would they
        say of her in the Stores when they found out that she had run away with
        a fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place would be filled up
        by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She had always had an edge
        on her, especially whenever there were people listening. "Miss Hill,
        don't you see these ladies are waiting?" "Look lively, Miss Hill,
        please." She would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores. But in her
        new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like that. Then
        she would be married -- she, Eveline. People would treat her with
        respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been. Even now,
        though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger of
        her father's violence. She knew it was that that had given her the
        palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for her like
        he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl but latterly
        he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for
        her dead mother's sake. And no she had nobody to protect her. Ernest was
        dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly
        always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable squabble
        for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably. She
        always gave her entire wages -- seven shillings -- and Harry always sent
        up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from her father.
        He said she used to squander the money, that she had no head, that he
        wasn't going to give her his hard-earned money to throw about the
        streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad on Saturday night.
        In the end he would give her the money and ask her had she any intention
        of buying Sunday's dinner. Then she had to rush out as quickly as she
        could and do her marketing, holding her black leather purse tightly in
        her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and returning home
        late under her load of provisions. She had hard work to keep the house
        together and to see that the two young children who had been left to hr
        charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly. It was
        hard work -- a hard life -- but now that she was about to leave it she
        did not find it a wholly undesirable life. She was about to explore
        another life with Frank. Frank was very kind, manly, open-hearted. She
        was to go away with him by the night-boat to be his wife and to live
        with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home waiting for her. How well
        she remembered the first time she had seen him; he was lodging in a
        house on the main road where she used to visit. It seemed a few weeks
        ago. He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap pushed back on his head
        and his hair tumbled forward over a face of bronze. Then they had come
        to know each other. He used to meet her outside the Stores every evening
        and see her home. He took her to see The Bohemian Girl and she felt
        elated as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He
        was awfully fond of music and sang a little. People knew that they were
        courting and, when he sang about the lass that loves a sailor, she
        always felt pleasantly confused. He used to call her Poppens out of fun.
        First of all it had been an excitement for her to have a fellow and then
        she had begun to like him. He had tales of distant countries. He had
        started as a deck boy at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line
        going out to Canada. He told her the names of the ships he had been on
        and the names of the different services. He had sailed through the
        Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians.
        He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to
        the old country just for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out
        the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him. "I know
        these sailor chaps," he said. One day he had quarrelled with Frank and
        after that she had to meet her lover secretly. The evening deepened in
        the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct. One was
        to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest had been her favourite but
        she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he
        would miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when
        she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and
        made toast for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was
        alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She
        remembered her father putting on her mothers bonnet to make the children
        laugh. Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window,
        leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty
        cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing.
        She knew the air Strange that it should come that very night to remind
        her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together
        as long as she could. She remembered the last night of her mother's
        illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the
        hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ-player
        had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She remembered her
        father strutting back into the sickroom saying: "Damned Italians! coming
        over here!" As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother's life laid
        its spell on the very quick of her being -- that life of commonplace
        sacrifices closing in final craziness. She trembled as she heard again
        her mother's voice saying constantly with foolish insistence: "Derevaun
        Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!" She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror.
        Escape! She must escape! Frank would save her. He would give her life,
        perhaps love, too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy?
        She had a right to happiness. Frank would take her in his arms, fold her
        in his arms. He would save her. She stood among the swaying crowd in the
        station at the North Wall. He held her hand and she knew that he was
        speaking to her, saying something about the passage over and over again.
        The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages. Through the wide
        doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat,
        lying in beside the quay wall, with illumined portholes. She answered
        nothing. She felt her cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of
        distress, she prayed to God to direct her, to show her what was her
        duty. The boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist. If she went,
        tomorrow she would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos
        Ayres. Their passage had been booked. Could she still draw back after
        all he had done for her? Her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she
        kept moving her lips in silent fervent prayer. A bell clanged upon her
        heart. She felt him seize her hand: "Come!" All the seas of the world
        tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them: he would drown
        her. She gripped with both hands at the iron railing. "Come!" No! No!
        No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the
        seas she sent a cry of anguish. "Eveline! Evvy!" He rushed beyond the
        barrier and called to her to follow. He was shouted at to go on but he
        still called to her. She set her white face to him, passive, like a
        helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of love or farewell or
        recognition.
